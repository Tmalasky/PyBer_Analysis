## Overview
### For this analysis I am helping my friend V. Isualie create a Data Frame for the ride share company called PyBer. We do this by using Python skills and knowledge of Pandas to study their ride-sharing data by city type. We compiled the Data into a Data Frame and then make a multiple-line chart using matplotlib to show our work. 

## Results
### Here are the results of compiling the data and the multiple-line chart showing our work.

## Summary
### As you can see based on the results, we found the bigger cities have more total rides and drivers but make less money per ride and per driver. The Rural cities have way less rides and drivers but the mark up per ride and per driver are more. That may be due to the distance for the ride because they are in a smaller city and are riding further to the bigger city. We could try to get more Rural drivers to drive more in Suburban or Urban city with incentive program or vis-versa with Urban drivers to drive out to Rural cities. I would suggest also to make an ad campaign to target for Rural and Suburban cities to get more drivers and increase both numbers in those cities.
